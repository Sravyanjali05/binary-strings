Given four integers x,y,a and b .
 Determine if there exists a binary string having x 0's 
and y 1's such that the total number of subsequences equal
 to the sequence "01" in it is a and the total number of subsequences equal to the sequence 
"10" in it is b .

A binary string is a string made of the characters '0' and '1' only.

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b  if a can be
 obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Answer...

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i,t;
    long long int a[4];
    scanf("%d",&t);
    for(int i=0;i<t;i++)
    {
        for(int j=0;j<4;j++)
          scanf("%lld",&a[j]);
        if(a[0]*a[1]==a[2]+a[3])
            printf("Yes\n");
        else
         printf("No\n");
    }
      return 0;

}
